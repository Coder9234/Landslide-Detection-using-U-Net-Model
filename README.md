# Landslide-Detection-using-U-Net-Model

## Description:
Landslides, with their capacity to cause widespread destruction and loss of life, demand advanced solutions
for early detection and management. This project presents an innovative approach to tackle this challenge
by developing a custom U-Net deep learning model for landslide detection. Leveraging satellite imagery
from sources like Sentinel-2 and ALOS PALSAR, the project aspires to enhance the accuracy and
efficiency of post-landslide identification. Traditional monitoring methods are often limited in their capacity
to scale, respond swiftly, and provide precise results. In contrast, the project's custom U-Net model
harnesses the power of deep convolutional neural networks, offering a data-driven and automated solution
for improved disaster management and risk reduction. The project also includes a comparative analysis of
the custom model against existing pre-built models, aiming to provide valuable insights into the advantages
and uniqueness of this cutting-edge approach to landslide detection. The model is evaluated qualitatively,
and five matrices, i.e. precision, recall, f1-score, loss, and overall accuracy (OA) are computed for
quantitative evaluation.
